## Credits
[Web Dev](https://web.dev/label/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=devtools) This link from Lighthouse talk me how to make a `input type=range` accessible with `label for`.

[The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6y1UVxr3jg&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gGrbtvASEZSlFEYBnPkmff&index=7) Taught me how to utilize Materialize CSS, Containers, Modals, etc.

[Range Slider Issue](https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize/issues/6036) Explained why some of the Materialize CSS features were not working for me.

[Styling the Range Slider](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40534973/changing-the-color-of-the-range-slider-in-materializecss) Taught me how to change the color of the range slider in Materialize CSS.

[Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-clear-sky-at-night-2885320/) I love getting free photos from this website!

[CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/o/overflow-wrap/) This article taught me how to wrap a long word, so the password did not overflow outside the box.

[jQuery A-Z](https://www.jquery-az.com/materialize/demo.php?ex=57.0_3) Here I learned how to add box-shadow to checkboxes.

[Button Color](https://materializecss.com/color.html) Materialize CSS provides a very beautiful and generous palette of color options.

[DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKXv_ZHQ654) Gary Simon is awesome! He taught me how to set up a Dark Mode toggle on this project.

[Background Image Sizing](https://css-tricks.com/forums/topic/background-image-height-problem-not-fitting-to-the-screen/) Another great CSS Tricks article that helped me make sure the background-image covered the entire background.

[CSS Portal](https://www.cssportal.com/style-input-range/) This website helped me change the size of the range slider in Materialize CSS.

[MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event) Here I learned how to utilize the change event for sensing when a checkbox has been checked or unchecked.

[CSS Tricks: Fallback Colors](https://css-tricks.com/css-basics-using-fallback-colors/) I learned how to fall back on background colors if/when my background images for some reason do not load.

[MDN Docs: querySelectorAll](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) Showed me how to further narrow my query so that I did not include toggle when I searched for checked boxes.

[Marcus Burnette // Codepen](https://codepen.io/mburnette/pen/LxNxNg) I followed along Gary Simon's tutorial, where he styles dark mode based off this pen of a toggler made by Marcus.

[Tiny PNG](https://tinypng.com/) This website allowed me to compress my background images and shave off over 2000 kilobytes!

[Optimizilla](https://imagecompressor.com/)Here I was able to further reduce background image size from megabytes to <250kb each.

[Check if an Element contains a Class](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/dom/css/check-if-an-element-contains-a-class/) Uses .contains() method.

[Jennifer Kirwin](https://jenniferkirwin.github.io/password-generator2/) Jennifer's brilliant styles influenced me on utilizing Materialize CSS. Hopefully someday I'll understand what she did with arrays as well! Definitely worth reading her code.

[Jamie Rachael](https://jamierachael.github.io/Password-Generator/) Jamie's custom design first encouraged me to improve the original template provided to us. I also really liked her 'Copy to Clipboard' feature, but in the interest of trying something new, I combined 'Generate' and 'Copy' into one button on my project.
